# learning-DSA

Quick repo first of all about data structures and afterwords Algorithms

## Goals
  1. To have all the data structures possible whitin C++ (each one of them in a separet folder)
  2. Link also some work related to algorithms with those differents Data-Structures.
  
## TODO

### Linear Data Structure

###### Dynamic Data Structure
- [ ] Linked-List
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Stack

###### Static Data Structure
- [ ] Array

### Non-linear Data Structure
- [ ] Tree
- [ ] Graph
